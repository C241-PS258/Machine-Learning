# Machine-Learning

In this project, we develop a model to detect images and identify the type of freshwater fish shown by the user. This model employs a transfer learning model named InceptionV3, which we use to improve our accuracy through a fine-tuning method. The model was trained for 33 epochs initially, followed by 15 epochs forÂ fine-tuning.

We got the result :
